Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment                 July 2011


1.  Introduction

   [DKIM] defines a mechanism for transparent domain-level signing of
   messages for the purpose of declaring that a particular
   Administrative Mail Domain (ADMD) takes some responsibility for a
   message.  [ADSP] creates a mechanism by which an ADMD can declare
   that mail from it is expected to include a valid DKIM signature from
   that same ADMD, and mail that does not should be considered suspect
   or even refused by receivers.

   Absent is a mechanism by which an ADMD can announce that signatures
   on its mail from other ADMDs should also be considered authentic by
   verifiers.  This memo presents an experimental mechanism for doing
   so.

2.  Definitions

2.1.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

2.2.  E-Mail Architecture Terminology

   Readers should be familiar with the material and terminology
   discussed in [MAIL] and [EMAIL-ARCH].

3.  Discussion

   Participation in this protocol is divided into two parties: Senders,
   whose domains appear in the RFC5322.From field of a [MAIL] message,
   and Verifiers, who implement the validation procedures described in
   both [DKIM] and [ADSP].

   A Sender participates in this protocol if it wishes to announce that
   a message from it (in the RFC5322.From sense) should be considered
   authentic as long as it bears a signature from any in a set of
   specified domains.  One might, for example, wish to delegate signing
   authority for its DNS domain to an approved messaging service
   provider without doing the work of key transfer described in Appendix
   B.1.1 of [DKIM].

   A Verifier participates in this protocol if it wishes to ensure that
   a message bears one or more signatures from sources approved to sign
   mail on behalf of the Sender, and identify for special treatment mail
   that does not meet that criterion.

Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment                 July 2011


   A Verifier with this interest has presumably already implemented ADSP
   and is therefore making one DNS query for each DKIM signature (to
   retrieve the matching public key) on the message, and one to check
   for any published ADSP record.  Given this, it seems to make sense
   that the ADSP record is the right place to declare that this
   extension is in use.  Therefore, a tag indicating this extension will
   be added to ADSP.

4.  Queries and Replies

   This section describes in detail the queries issued, the replies
   received, and how they should be interpreted and applied.

4.1.  Extension to ADSP

   [ADSP] replies contain a "tag=value" sequence, but only one tag
   ("dkim") is currently defined.

   This protocol will add an additional tag "atps" whose value is "y" if
   this extension is in use.  The absence of this tag, or its presence
   with any other value, MUST be ignored and the Verifier MUST act as if
   this protocol is not in use.

   The formal syntax definition, per [ABNF]:

           adsp-atps-tag = %x61.74.70.73 *WSP "=" *WSP %x79

   The registration for this tag can be found in Section 5.

4.2.  ATPS Query Details

   If a Sender announces via the ADSP extension that it is using this
   protocol and the Verifier is also participating, then the Verifier
   issues a TXT query to the DNS to a specific name looking for
   confirmation by the Sender that a particular third party signature is
   authorized by the Sender.  The query SHOULD be repeated for every
   domain found in the "d=" tag of a [DKIM] signature on the message
   that verified and is not otherwise considered unacceptable to the
   Verifier for policy reasons.  These MAY be done in any order or MAY
   be done in parallel.

   Where the RFC5322.From field contains multiple addresses, this
   process MAY be repeated for each domain found in the field, and these
   MAY be done in any order.

   The name for the query is constructed as follows:





Kucherawy               Expires January 28, 2012                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment                 July 2011


   1.  Extract the value of the "d=" tag from the signature.

   2.  Convert any upper-case characters in that string to their lower-
       case equivalents.

   3.  Feed the resulting string to the [SHA1] hash algorithm.

   4.  Convert the output of the SHA1 hash to a string of 32
       alphanumeric characters by applying base32 encoding as defined in
       Section 6 of [BASE32].  The base32 encoding is used because its
       output is restricted to characters that are legal for use in
       labels in the DNS, and evaluates the same way in the DNS whether
       encoded using uppercase or lowercase characters.

   5.  Append the string "._atps."

   6.  Append the domain name found in the RFC5322.From field of the
       message.

   The query's formal syntax definition, per [ABNF]:

           atps-query = 32*BASE32 %x2e.5f.61.74.70.73.2e domain-name

           BASE32 = ( ALPHA / %x32-37 )

   The "domain-name" is as defined in Section 3.5 of [DKIM].

   See Appendix A for an example of a query construction.

   Since the size of a [DNS] query is limited to 255 bytes, the size of
   "domain-name" in the ABNF above is constrained to 216 bytes.

4.3.  ATPS Reply Details

   In the descriptions below, the label NOERROR symbolizes DNS response
   code ("rcode") 0, and NXDOMAIN represents rcode 3.  See Section 4.1.1
   of [DNS] for further details.

   At this time, only three possibilities need to be identified in this
   specification:

   o  An answer is returned (i.e.  [DNS] reply code NOERROR with at
      least one answer) containing a valid ATPS reply.  In this case,
      the protocol has been satisfied and the Verifier may conclude that
      the signing domain is authorized by the Sender to sign its mail.
      Further queries SHOULD NOT be initiated.

Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment                 July 2011


   o  No answer is returned (i.e.  [DNS] reply code NXDOMAIN, or NOERROR
      with no answers), or one or more answers have been returned as
      described above but none contain a valid ATPS reply.  In this
      case, the "d=" domain has not been authorized to act as a third-
      party signer for this Sender, and thus the Verifier MUST continue
      to the next query.

   o  An error is returned (i.e. any other [DNS] reply code).  It is no
      longer possible to determine whether or not this message satisfies
      the Sender's list of authorized third-party signers.  The Verifier
      SHOULD stop processing and defer the message for later processing,
      such as requesting temporary failure code from the MTA.

   If all queries are completed and return NXDOMAIN, then the message
   does not satisfy the policy advertised by the Sender, and the
   action(s) specified by the "dkim" tag in the ADSP reply SHOULD be
   applied.

   A valid ATPS reply consists of a sequence of tag-value pairs as
   described in Section 3.2 of [DKIM].  The following tag and value is
   the only one currently supported in ATPS records:

   v: Version (plain-text; REQUIRED) This tag defines the version of
      this specification that applies to the ATPS record.  It MUST have
      the value "ATPS1".  ABNF:

           atps-v-tag = %x76 [FWS] "=" [FWS] %x41.54.50.53.31

5.  IANA Considerations

   No actions are required by IANA at this time.  The following need
   only be applied if and when this specification reaches the Standards
   Track.

5.1.  ATPS Tag Registry

   An Authorized Third Party Signature (ATPS) Tag Registry will be
   created by IANA to enumerate the tags that are valid for use in ATPS
   records.

   New registrations or updates MUST be published in accordance with the
   "Specification Required" guidelines described in
   [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS].  Such registry changes MUST contain the
   following information:

   1.  Name of the tag being registered or updated

   2.  The document where the specification is created or updated

   3.  The status of the tag, one of "current" (tag is in current use),
       "deprecated" (tag is in current use but its use is discouraged),
       or "historic" (tag is no longer in use)

   The registry's sole initial entry is:

       +-----+--------------+---------+
       | Tag | Specified In | Status  |
       +-----+--------------+---------+
       |  v  | [this memo]  | current |

6.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses potential security issues related to this
   experimental protocol.

6.1.  Transient Security Failures

   Approving a third party signer exposes the Sender to the risk that
   the third party signer becomes compromised and then begins to sign
   malicious or nuisance messages on behalf of the Sender.  This can
   obviously reflect negatively on the Sender, and the impact of this
   can become more severe as automated domain reputation systems are
   developed and deployed.  Thorough vetting and monitoring practices by

Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment                 July 2011


   Senders of third party signers will likely need to become the norm.

6.2.  Load on the DNS

   A Verifier participating in DKIM, ADSP and ATPS will now issue a
   number of TXT queries to the DNS equal to one (for the ADSP query)
   plus twice the number of valid signatures on the message (one for
   each key, one for an ATPS record) plus the number of invalid
   signatures on the message (one for each key).  This is in addition to
   any PTR and A queries the MTA may issue at the time the actual
   message relaying or delivery is initiated.  Obviously this can be
   burdensome on the DNS at both ends, and waiting for that number of
   queries to return when they are issued in parallel could trigger
   timeouts in the MTA.

   An alternative to this that has not yet been explored is the storage
   of the ATPS data at a specific URL tied to the Sender's domain name.
   This would alleviate pressure on the DNS at the expense of requiring
   the Sender to operate a web server (which has its own security
   implications) and the addition of the establishment of a TCP
   connection.  Moreover, the Verifier would be well advised to
   implement caching of this data to prevent ATPS from being used as a
   denial-of-service vector.

Appendix A.  Example Query and Reply

   This section presents an example of the use of this protocol to query
   for a third-party authorization and discusses the interpretation of
   the result.

   Presume a message for which the RFC5322.From domain is "example.com",
   and it bears two valid signatures, one from "one.example.net" and one
   from "two.example.net".  The following actions are taken:

   1.  A TXT query is made, per [ADSP], to
       "_adsp._domainkey.example.com" to query for its Author Domain
       Signing Practices.  If no valid reply is returned or the reply
       does not contain an "atps" tag with value "y", the algorithm
       stops with [AUTHRES] result "none".

   2.  A SHA1 hash of "one.example.net" is computed and then converted
       to printable form using base32 encoding, resulting in the string
       "QSP4I4D24CRHOPDZ3O3ZIU2KSGS3X6Z6".

   3.  A TXT query is issued to
       "QSP4I4D24CRHOPDZ3O3ZIU2KSGS3X6Z6._atps.example.com".

   4.  If a reply arrives, the algorithm stops with [AUTHRES] result
       "pass".  If a DNS error code other than NXDOMAIN is returned, the
       algorithm stops with a result of "temperror" or "permerror" as
       appropriate.

   5.  A SHA1 hash of "two.example.net" is computed and then converted
       to printable form using base32 encoding, resulting in the string
       "ZTZGRRV3F45A4U6HLDKBF3ZCOW4V2AJX".

   6.  A TXT query is issued to
       "ZTZGRRV3F45A4U6HLDKBF3ZCOW4V2AJX._atps.example.com".

   7.  If a reply arrives, the algorithm stops with [AUTHRES] result
       "pass".  If a DNS error code other than NXDOMAIN is returned, the
       algorithm stops with a result of "temperror" or "permerror" as
       appropriate.

   8.  As there are no valid signatures left to test, the algorithm
       stops with a result of "unknown", "fail" or "discard" as per the
       value on the ADSP "dkim" tag.
