Internet-Draft    Reputation Queries with HTTP and JSON       April 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a method to query a reputation data service for
   information about an entity, using the HyperText Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) as the transport mechanism and JSON as the payload format.


2.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

2.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

2.2.  Other Definitions

   Other terms of importance in this document are defined in
   [I-D.REPUTE-MODEL] and [I-D.REPUTE-MEDIA-TYPE].


3.  Description

3.1.  Query

   A reputation query made via [HTTP] encodes the question being asked
   in the GET instruction of the protocol.

   The components to the question being asked comprise the following:

   o  The subject of the query;

   o  The name of the host, or the IP address, at which the reputation
      service is available;

   o  The name of the reputation application, i.e., the context within
      which the query is being made;

   o  Optionally, name(s) of the specific reputation assertions or
      attributies that are being requested.

   The name of the application, if given, MUST be one registered with
   IANA.  A server receiving a query about an unregistered application
   or one it does not explicitly support MUST return a 404 error code.

   The syntax for the [URI] portion of the query is constructed using a

   template as per [URI-TEMPLATE].  The following variables MUST be
   available during template expansion:

   application:  The name of the application reputation in whose context
      the request is being made.

   scheme:  The transport scheme the client will be using for the query.

   service:  The hostname or IP address being queried.

   subject:  The subject of the query.

   Which scheme(s) can be used depends on how the reputation service
   provider offers its services.  Thus, the template could include a
   specific scheme as a fixed string in the template, or it might offer
   it as a variable in the template.  If it is a variable, it is up to
   the client and server to negotiate out-of-band which schemes are
   supported for client queries.  Implementers need to be aware that the
   template could include a fixed scheme not supported by the client.

   The following variables are OPTIONAL, but might be required by the
   template presented for a specific service:

   assertion:  A list of one or more specific assertions of interest to
      the client.  If absent, the server MUST infer that all available
      assertion information is being requested.

   Other required or optional query parameters might be defined by
   documents that register new response sets with IANA.  Further, other
   required or optional query parameters might be defined by specific
   reputation service providers, though these are private arrangements
   between client and server and will not be registered with IANA.

   Authentication between reputation client and server MAY be
   accomplished using query extensions, or MAY rely on the capabilities
   of the transport associated with the selected URI scheme.

   The template is retrieved by requesting the [WELL-KNOWN-URI] "repute-
   template" from the host providing reputation service using HTTP.  The
   server SHOULD return the template in a text/plain reply.  If the
   template cannot be retrieved, the reputation query SHOULD be aborted
   and/or retried at a later time.  The server responding to the
   template request SHOULD include an Expires field indicating a
   duration for which the template should be considered valid by clients
   and not re-queried.  Clients SHOULD adhere to the expiration time
   thus provided or, if none is provided, assume that the template is
   valid for no less than one day and SHOULD NOT repeat the query.

   For example, given the following template:

   {scheme}://{service}/{application}/{subject}/{assertion}

   A query about the use of the domain "example.org" in the "email-id"
   application context to a service run at "example.com", where that
   application declares a required "subject" parameter, requesting the
   "SPAM" reputation assertion using HTTP to conduct the query with no
   specific client authentication information would be formed as
   follows:

   http://example.com/email-id/example.org/spam

   Matching of the attribute name(s) MUST be case-insensitive.

3.2.  Response

   The response is expected to be contained in a media type designed to
   deliver reputons.  An media type designed for this purpose,
   "application/reputon+json", is defined in [I-D.REPUTE-MEDIA-TYPE].


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the "repute-template" well-known URI in the
   Well-Known URI registry as defined by [WELL-KNOWN-URI], as follows:

   URI suffix:  repute-template

   Change controller:  IETF

   Specification document(s):  [this document]

   Related information:  none


5.  Security Considerations

   This section describes security considerations introduced by the
   query mechanism defined here.
