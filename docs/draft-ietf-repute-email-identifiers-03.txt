Internet-Draft  Email Identifiers Reputation Response Set     April 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a response set for describing reputation of
   an email identifier.  A "response set" in this context is defined in
   [I-D.REPUTE-MODEL] and is used to describe assertions a reputation
   service provider can make about email identifiers as well as meta-
   data that can be included in such a reply beyond the base set
   specified there.

   An atomic reputation response is called a "reputon", also defined in
   that document.


2.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

2.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

2.2.  Email Definitions

   Commonly used definitions describing entities in the email
   architecture are defined and discussed in [EMAIL-ARCH].

2.3.  Other Definitions

   Other terms of importance in this document are defined in
   [I-D.REPUTE-MODEL], the base document for the reputation services
   work.


3.  Discussion

   The expression of reputation about an email identifier requires
   extensions of the base set defined in [I-D.REPUTE-MODEL].  This
   document defines and registers some common assertions about an entity
   found in a piece of [MAIL].

3.1.  Assertions

   The "email-id" reputation application recognizes the following
   assertions:

   FRAUD:  The subject identifier is associated with sending or handling
      of fraudulent email, such as "phishing" (some good discussion on
      this topic can be found in [IODEF-PHISHING])

   MALWARE:  The subject identifier is associated with the sending or
      handling of malware via email

   SPAM:  The subject identifier is associated with sending or handling
      of unwanted bulk email

   INVALID-RECIPIENTS:  The subject identifier is associated with
      delivery attempts to nonexistent recipients

   For all assertions, the RATING scale is linear: A value of 0.0 means
   there is no data to support the assertion, a value of 1.0 means all
   accumulated data support the assertion, and the intervening values
   have a linear relationship (i.e., a score of "x" is twice as strong
   of an assertion as a value of "x/2").

3.2.  Response Set Extensions

   The "email-id" reputation application recognizes the following
   OPTIONAL extensions to the basic response set defined in
   [I-D.REPUTE-MODEL]:

   IDENTITY:  A token indicating the source of the identifier; that is,
      where the subject identifier was found in the message.  This MUST
      be one of:

      DKIM:  The signing domain, i.e. the value of the "d=" tag, found
         on a valid [DKIM] signature in the message

      IPV4:  The IPv4 address of the client

      IPV6:  The IPv6 address of the client

      RFC5321.HELO:  The RFC5321.Helo value used by the (see [SMTP])
         client

      RFC5321.MAILFROM:  The RFC5321.MailFrom value of the envelope of a
         message of the message (see [SMTP])

      RFC5322.FROM:  The RFC5322.From field of the message (see [MAIL])

      SPF:  The domain name portion of the identifier (RFC5321.MailFrom
         or RFC5321.Helo) verified by [SPF])

   SOURCES:  A token relating a count of the number of sources of data
      that contributed to the reported reputation.  This is in contrast
      to the SAMPLE-SIZE parameter, which indicates the total number of
      reports across all reporting sources.

   A reply that does not contain the IDENTITY or SOURCES extensions is
   making a non-specific statement about how the reputation returned was
   developed.  A client can use or ignore such a reply at its
   discretion.

3.3.  Query Extensions

   A query within this application can include the OPTIONAL query
   parameter "identity" to indicate which specific identity is of
   interest to the query.  Legal values are the same as those listed in
   Section 3.2.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo presents one action for IANA, namely the registration of
   the reputation application "email-id".

4.1.  Registration of 'email-id' Reputation Application

   This section registers the "email-id" reputation application, as per
   the IANA Considerations section of [I-D.REPUTE-MODEL].  The
   registration parameters are as folows:

   o  Application name: email-id

   o  Short description: Evaluates DNS domain names found in email
      identifiers

   o  Defining document: [this document]

   o  Status: current

   o  Subject: A string appropriate to the identifier of interest (see
      Section 3.2 of this document)

   o  Application-specific query parameters:

      identity:  (current) as defined in Section 3.3 of this document

   o  Application-specific extensions:

      identity:  (current) as defined in Section 3.2 of this document


5.  Security Considerations

   This section describes security considerations introduced by the
   reputation application and response set extensions defined here.
