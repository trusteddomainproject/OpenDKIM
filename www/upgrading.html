<h1>Upgrading</h1>
<p>
This page contains information about upgrading from various versions
of this package to the current one, or in some cases from other similar
packages to this one.
</p>

<p>
Only changes that must be made (i.e. those for which there is no backward
compatibility) are described here.  See the <tt>RELEASE_NOTES</tt> file
for more information on the full set of changes in each release to see if
there are other changes of interest.

<h3>dkim-milter</h3>

<p>
Since OpenDKIM came into being as a code fork from Sendmail, Inc.'s
<b>dkim-milter</b> package, there is a great deal of backward compatibility
that package.  However, a few things have changed:

<ul>
 <li> In version 2.1.0 of OpenDKIM, a number of command line options were
      removed as they are redundant to the configuration file and generally
      access to them at the command line is not useful (i.e. there's little
      chance one would need to change them quickly, such as during testing).
      See the <a href="#2.1.0">OpenDKIM 2.1.0</a> section for specifics.
 <li> In version 2.0.0 of OpenDKIM, the <tt>KeyList</tt> configuration
      parameter and its corresponding command line flag were removed and
      replaced by a new mechanism for doing key sets.  See the
      <a href="#2.0.0">OpenDKIM 2.0.0</a> section for specifics.
</ul>
</p>

<h3> <a name="2.1.0"> OpenDKIM 2.1.0 </a> </h3>

<p>
Version 2.1.0 pruned a number of command line flags that were not in common
use and were redundant to configuration file items.  The ones left behind
were those likely to be inconvenient to writing shell scripts (especially
the automated start/stop type) if removed.  This meant any such scripts
that used them before would have to be updated.  The removed options were:

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-a</tt> peer host list
 <li> <tt>-C</tt> error handling configuration
 <li> <tt>-h</tt> add X-DKIM header field
 <li> <tt>-i</tt> internal hosts list
 <li> <tt>-I</tt> external hosts list
 <li> <tt>-m</tt> MTA names list
 <li> <tt>-M</tt> MTA macro names/values list
 <li> <tt>-P</tt> PID file to create (re-added in 2.1.3)
 <li> <tt>-R</tt> send failure reports
 <li> <tt>-U</tt> POP-before-SMTP database
</ul>
</p>

<h3> <a name="2.0.0"> OpenDKIM 2.0.0 </a> </h3>

<p>
In OpenDKIM 2.0.0, the <tt>KeyList</tt> parameter was removed.  The function
previously served by that file has been split into two new settings, namely
<tt>KeyTable</tt> (which gives a list of key names that map to a domain,
a selector and a private key) and <tt>SigningTable</tt> which matches
message senders to specific keys named in the key table.  Detailed
instructions for making this conversion are available in the file
<tt>opendkim/README</tt> in the source code tarball.
