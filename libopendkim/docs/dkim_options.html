<!----------- Flags ---------->
<tr>
<th valign="top" align=left>FLAGS</th> 
<td>
When setting or retrieving library flags, the method is to specify
a bitwise-OR of flag bits in an unsigned integer.  The recognized flags
are:
<table border="1" cellspacing=0>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_ACCEPTDK</tt></td>
  <td>Allow references to key records formatted for DomainKeys (RFC4870).
      This means a key record retrieved from DNS that has no "v=" tag
      will be treated slightly differently; specifically, an empty "g="
      tag in the key matches all senders (the DomainKeys way) rather than
      no senders (the DKIM way).  This flag has no other effect. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_ACCEPTV05</tt></td>
  <td>Accept signatures with version strings of "0.5", i.e. those which
      were based on some draft versions of the DKIM specification.  Note that
      this does not change or relax the rules applied by this implementation,
      and thus these older signatures still may not verify due to evolutions
      of the specification that took place during the use of that version
      string. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_BADSIGHANDLES</tt></td>
  <td>Create DKIM_SIGINFO handles even for signatures that had syntax errors.
      This also means
      <a href="dkim_chunk.html"><tt>dkim_chunk()</tt></a> will not return
      a syntax error code when it encounters a DKIM signature with a syntax
      error in it. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_CACHE</tt></td>
  <td>Maintain a local cache of retrieved key records, rather
      than relying on the DNS servers to do so.  May improve performance
      if, for example, the DNS server is not local.  Requires that libopendkim
      be compiled with the <tt>QUERY_CACHE</tt> option since doing so
      adds a library dependency to the build. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_DELAYSIGPROC</tt></td>
  <td>Normally the key retrieval and public key validation takes place in
      the <a href="dkim_eoh.html"><tt>dkim_eoh()</tt></a> function, and
      the body hash verification takes place in
      <a href="dkim_eom.html"><tt>dkim_eom()</tt></a> function.  Setting
      this flag delays all processing of signatures until <tt>dkim_eom()</tt>.
      This means the caller will be unable to evaluate signature validity
      on completion of <tt>dkim_eoh()</tt> and will have to wait until
      after <tt>dkim_eom()</tt> (or the final processing callback if such
      is defined). </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_DROPSIGNER</tt></td>
  <td>If a caller attempts to generate a signature for which a specific
      signer address is requested and the domain of the signer is not the
      same as or a subdomain of the signing domain, the default behaviour
      is to return an error from
      <a href="dkim_gensighdr.html"><tt>dkim_gensighdr()</tt></a> since a
      signature thus generated would violate the DKIM specification.  If
      this flag is set, the signature will still be generated but the "i="
      tag will be omitted so the signature is still compliant. </t>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_EOHCHECK</tt></td>
  <td>Perform a signature check at the end of
      <a href="dkim_eoh.html"><tt>dkim_eoh()</tt></a>.
      This will cause <tt>dkim_eoh()</tt> to return an error code if no
      usable signatures were found in the message. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_FIXCRLF</tt></td>
  <td>Convert "naked" CR and LF characters into CRLFs when canonicalizing.
      </td>
 </tr>

  <td>Keep temporary files for manual debugging purposes.  (Also requires that
      <tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_TMPFILES</tt> be set.)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_REPORTBADADSP</tt></td>
  <td>When doing the ADSP query, a response that is a syntax error will by
      default be ignored.  Setting this flag causes an error to be returned.
      This can be common when, for example, wildcard TXT records are used to
      publish other data. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_REQUESTREPORTS</tt></td>
  <td>Includes an "r=y" tag in generated signatures, requesting participating
      verifiers send back forensic information about the verified message
      when validation fails.  Useful for debugging signature validation
      issues. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_SIGNLEN</tt></td>
  <td>When signing messages, include in the signature the number of bytes
      that were canonicalized even when a length limit wasn't specified
      by the caller. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_STRICTHDRS</tt></td>
  <td>Refuse to sign or verify a message that doesn't conform to the header
      field count rules specified in RFC5322 Section 3.6, and have a properly
      formed From field.  Other checks may also be enforced in the future. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><tt>DKIM_LIBFLAGS_STRICTRESIGN</tt></td>
  <td>Refuse to generate a signature from a signing handle bound to a

  <td>When verifying, only process signatures until the first good one
      is found (by default, all of them will be attempted). </td>
