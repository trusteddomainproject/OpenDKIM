ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================

The following environment variables are checked and have some impact on
what libdkim does:

DKIM_TMPDIR	directory in which temporary files are created; default is
		/tmp


SELF-TEST
=========

A number of self-test programs are included here for unit-testing the
library.  To run them, type "make check".  A brief description of each
test will be provided before its result.  If the description is followed by
the word SKIPPED, it means support for the function (e.g. an external
library) to be tested was not available at compile-time and the test was
not run.


CRYPTO LIBRARIES
================

Cryptography libraries, such as openssl and gnutls, that can be used with
libopendkim may have initialization requirements.  libopendkim will not
initialize these libraries for you, as doing so may interfere with other
aspects of the application calling this library.  It is therefore the
responsibility of the calling application to initailize the crypto library
before attempting DKIM signing or validation, or unexpected errors can occur.
