OPENDKIM CHROOT NOTES
=====================

Contributed by Andreas Schulze

Running opendkim chroot adds an additional layer of complexity. It is disabled
by default.  Only advanced users only should try to enable that special
configuration.  To successfull setup a chroot jail you must configure opendkim
to run *without* that restriction first!

enabling chroot jail
====================
chroot is enabled by adding "ChangeRootDirectory /path/to/chroot" to
opendkim.conf.  Then you must restart opendkim.

setting up syslog
=================
opendkim requieres a syslog socket inside the chroot.  You have to edit your
syslog daemon configuration.

  for rsyslog:
  $AddUnixListenSocket /path/to/chroot/dev/log"

  for syslog-ng:
  unix-dgram("/path/to/chroot/dev/log");

After restarting the syslog daemon you may want to check if the syslog socket
is really present.

  test -S /path/to/chroot/dev/log || echo "socket missing"

setting up resolving
====================
The next point is only required if opendkim is compiled with the optional code
option "USE_UNBOUND" and you activated "ResolverConfiguration" in opendkim.conf.
Then you must place the unbound configuration file inside /path/to/chroot. If
your unbound.conf includes other files such dnssec keys, these file must also
be placed inside /path/to/chroot.

  opendkim.conf:
  ResolverConfiguration	/inside_chroot/unbound.conf

setup entropie
==============
opendkim needs access to /dev/random or a similiar random generator.

  for linux:
  install -d /path/to/chroot/dev/
  mknod --mode 666 /path/to/chroot/dev/random c 1 8

simple signing setup
====================

  opendkim.conf:
  Mode		s
  Domain	example.org
  Selector	default
  KeyFile	/real/path/to/keyfile

In this case no further action is required.

more complex signing setup
==========================

  opendkim.conf:
  Mode		s
  SigningTable	refile:/real/path/to/signingtable
  KeyTable	file:/real/path/to/keytable

  /real/path/to/signingtable:
  *@example.org	examplekey

  /real/path/to/keytable:
  examplekey	example.org:default:/inside_chroot/key.private

You have to put your signing keys inside /path/to/chroot.

Validation
==========

validation requires additional libraries to fetch keys from dns.
To copy the right libraries into the chroot you may use scripts provided
by postfix.

download the postfix source tarball from a mirror listed at 
www.postfix.org/download.html. The directory examples/chroot-setup contain
scripts to setup a postfixchroot for many platforms.

At least the script LINUX2 is perfect to setup a chroot for opendkim too:

  POSTFIX_DIR=/path/to/dkim-chroot
  export POSTFIX_DIR
  sh -x /path/to/postfix-source/examples/chroot-setup/LINUX2

Users of other platforms are invided to share their solution on the
opendkim-users mailing-list.
