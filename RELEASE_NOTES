	LIBOPENDKIM: Tighten relaxed modes to break on only DKIM-defined
		whitespace characters.  Problem noted by Elizabeth Zwicky.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #208: If a signature fails to verify for either
		reason (header hash mismatched or body hash mismatched), set
		DKIM_SIGERROR_BADSIG so that Authentication-Results doesn't
		report a failure with "no signature error".
	TOOLS: Feature request #178: Add "-F" flag to opendkim-genzone so
		records are created with the FQDN.  Patch from Andreas Schulze.

		Problem noted by Amal Francis.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Only call dkiml_dns_close() if there was a
		dkiml_dns_service handle set by dkiml_dns_init().  Also,
		when closing, reset that handle to NULL.
	LIBOPENDKIM: The various dkim_dns_set_*() functions, when passed a
		NULL function pointer, merely store it, making the
		corresponding function a no-op.  Previously, doing
		so restored the default.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Have dkim_sig_getreportinfo() return descriptors
		(if available) regardless of the signer's reporting parameters.

		small.  This also adds a new "On-SignatureError" handler
		setting, and a new status code DKIM_STAT_SIGGEN.  Problem
		noted by Jim Fenton.
	Fix application of "On-InternalError" setting.  Problem noted by
		Claus Assmann.
	Feature request #SF3609496: Don't apply reputation checks to internal

		Problem noted by John Wood.

2.8.0		2013/02/25
	Feature request #SF2964383: Add DKIM_LIBFLAGS_STRICTRESIGN, which
		inhibits signing of a handle tagged for resigning when the
		attached verifying handle had no valid signatures in it.
	Feature request #SF3155117: Do a more thorough check for writeable
		key files, checking more of the filesystem permission tree.
	Feature request #SF3530734: Add "LDAPDisableCache", which suppresses
		the creation of a local cache in front of LDAP queries.
		Requested by Quanah Gibson-Mount.
	Feature request #SF3547359: If compiled with libcurl, add "SMTPURI"
		configuration option that allows direct SMTP transmission
		failure reports.  Requested by Andreas Schulze.

		"DisableCryptoInit" so that opendkim's initialization of the
		crypto library doesn't conflict with the same work done by
		other libraries.  Reported by Quanah Gibson-Mount.
	Fix bug #SF3599901: Rename "InsecureKey" to "UnprotectedKey" and
		"InsecurePolicy" to "UnprotectedPolicy", as the term "insecure"
		in reference to a key is sometimes interpreted to mean "not
		enough random bits" rather than as a keyword describing the
		presence or absence of DNSSEC protection.  What's logged in
		Authentication-Results header fields has been similarly
		modified.  Suggested by Scott Kitterman.
	Fix bug #SF3604525: Don't divide by zero when the query cache hasn't
		been used.  Reported by Denis Klimov.

		Suggested by Christophe Wolfhugel.
	CONTRIB: Add systemd directory.  Contributed by Steve Jenkins.
	CONTRIB: Split out initial key generation function from
		contrib/init/redhat/opendkim.  Contributed by Steve Jenkins.
	MILTERTEST: Don't crash in mt_connect() if the socketspec doesn't
		contain a colon.
	MILTERTEST: When connect() fails for an AF_INET socket, it apparently
		leaves the socket unusable.  Discard the socket when that
		happens and get a new one.
	MILTERTEST: Add a way to extend the mt.connect() retry interval via
		environment variables so a large test suite can be easily
		extended on slow systems.  Problem noted by Scott Kitterman.

		of tokens.  Problem noted by Motohiro Ishiyama and John Wood.
	Avoid mixing up status codes when processing conf_logresults, leading
		to confusing log entries.  Problem reported by John Wood.
	Fix ADSP logging.  Problem noted by Claus Assmann.

2.7.3		2012/11/29
	Log DB error string in dkimf_add_signrequest(), and fix a DSN handling
		error in dkimf_db_strerror().  Problem noted by
		Simone Caruso.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Ignore entries in the oversign header field name list
		that are empty, and an oversign header field name list that
		is present but empty.  Problem noted by Alec Peterson.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Allow header field lists to be empty, flushing any that
		were previously defined.  Problem noted by Alec Peterson.

		generally available.
	Feature request #SF3547124: Skip reputation checks on passing
		signatures whose keys had a "t=y" value.
	Feature request #SF3555842: Add "ReputationTest" setting.  Requested
		by Andreas Schulze.

		DKIM_OPTS_ALWAYSHDRS.
	Fix bug #SF3536655: Rename "X-Header" to "SoftwareHeader", and rename

		(and the current REPUTE WG drafts).  Problem noted by
		Andreas Schulze.

		Patch from Andreas Schulze.
	Add _FFR_REPRRD, which is a second approach to DKIM-based reputation
		using round robin databases and Holt-Winters foreacasting
		using rrdtool (see http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/).  Still
		experimental.
	Patch #SF3555843: With sufficient verbosity, report the default
		configuration file path.  Patch from Andreas Schulze.
	BUILD: Fix bug #SF3531658: Move the strlcat() and strlcpy()

		and dkim_sig_seterror(), define DKIM_CBSTAT_DEFAULT, and
		remove an assertion in dkim_get_key_dns(), which together
		allow for applications to develop non-standard key retrieval
		mechanisms.  Suggestion and patches from Ken Murchison.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #SF3559080: Log correct domains and selectors
		with SSL errors.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Add DNS functions dkim_dns_config(), dkim_dns_init(),

		dkim_dns_set_nslist(), dkim_dns_set_config(),
		dkim_dns_set_trustanchor(), dkim_dns_trustanchor().
	LIBOPENDKIM: Patch #SF3562496: Add DKIM_OPTS_REQUIREDHDRS to allow
		alteration of the mandatory header field set.  Patch from

1.2.0		2009/12/08
	Feature request #SF2873902: Overhaul the database backend code so that
		features that use external files or databases can be in any
		of several supported formats.  This will make adding new
		external data sources and formats simpler, and obviates the
		need for a bunch of individual feature requests.  This may
		have a few backward compatibility issues with respect to
		the configuration file.  Feature requested by Daniel Black.
	Feature request #SF2873900: Add optional support for OpenDBX for
		connecting to ODBC and SQL backend databases.  Requested
		by Daniel Black.
	Add "On-PolicyError" setting, allowing continuation of processing
		when an ADSP query fails.
	Activate _FFR_MULTIPLE_SIGNATURES, allowing optional addition of
		more than one signature per message passing through the
		filter.
	Add _FFR_RESIGN which allows binding of a signing handle to a
		verifying handle so that only one body hash needs to be
		run when a message will be re-signed as-is.  Suggested
		by Daniel Black.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Move VBR functions from libopendkim into their own
		new library, libvbr.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Rename the rfc2822_*() parsing functions to have
		"dkim_" prefixes, and rename their containing file
		accordingly.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fixes in relaxed body canonicalization and chunk
		processing.  Problems noted by Masumi Taketomi Parekh
		of Yahoo!.
	LIBOPENDKIM: New library flag DKIM_LIBFLAGS_BADSIGHANDLES which
		asks the library to tolerate signature syntax errors and
		make such signatures available for limited inspection
		rather than completely ignoring them.  Requested by Masumi
		Taketomi Parekh of Yahoo!.
	BUILD: Split up library assignments between libopendkim and opendkim,
		taking advantage of libtool.  Based on a patch by Daniel Black.
	BUILD: When possible, limit the symbols exported as part of
		libopendkim to only those listed in dkim.h.
	BUILD: Generate opendkim.conf.5 man page containing all features,
		including FFR, annotated with if they are included and their 
		experimental status (for FFRs).
	BUILD: Improve static linking against openssl as noted by Roman
		Gelfand.  Compiles against openssl version 1.0.0-beta4 now. 
	BUILD: Provide pkg-config files {opendkim,vbr,ar}.pc for use by 
		other applications.
	BUILD: Fix up libresolv detection.
	BUILD: Add pkg-config checks for openssl, tre and opendbx packages to
		determine their installed library locations. Automate 
		versioning and deployment.
	BUILD: Added m4 macro library directory with updated ax_pthread.m4.
	BUILD: Moved feature, _FFR and library #defines from Makefiles to 
		build-config.h. Added macros for FFR and FEATURES.
	BUILD: Add support for versions of libtre older than 0.8.0.
	BUILD: Move all libopendkim tests into their own subdirectory.

1.1.2		2009/11/01
	Under _FFR_SENDER_MACRO, need to check the value of "SenderMacro"
		in the configuration file.  Noted by Daniel Black.
	Feature request #SF2873901: Add _FFR_REDIRECT which optionally
		redirects messages that fail verification to a specific
		address, storing the original recipients in
		X-Original-Recipient: header fields.  Suggested by
		Daniel Black.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Have dkim_dns_set_callback() return
		DKIM_STAT_NOTIMPLEMENT if the underlying resolver doesn't
		have a callback facility.  Suggested by Daniel Black.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Move internal-only types and macros from dkim.h
		to dkim-internal.h.  Based on an idea from Daniel Black.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Add in all previously optional functions so that the
		API is invariant regardless of selected features.  Add
		dkim_libfeature() as a way to detect availability of features
		at runtime.  Suggested by Daniel Black.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Some global namespace consolidation.  Suggested by
		Daniel Black.
	BUILD: Fix bug #SF2882206, patch #SF2880986: Handle libtre
		installations where "--enable-system-abi" was selected.
		Reported by Stevan Bajic; patch from Daniel Black.
	BUILD: Convert libar compilation to the libtool method.
		Suggested by Daniel Black.
	BUILD: Minor autoconf fixes, contributed by Daniel Black.

1.1.1		2009/10/09
	Plug a number of potential but minor memory and file handle leaks,
		remove some dead code, guard against NULL dereferences, fix an
		errant return code check, fix a double-free(), and several
		other fixes found by a code analysis tool, used by courtesy
		of Cloudmark.
	Change "x-dkim-adsp" to "dkim-adsp" in Authentication-Results header
		field code now that RFC5617 is published.
	Apply "On-DNSError" setting when policy queries fail.
	BUILD: Some compilation fixes and type cleanup.  Based on patches
		provided by Daniel Black.
	Add _FFR_SENDER_MACRO: Determine the message sender based on the
		contents of a macro instead of on a header field.
		Based on a patch from Ondrej Sury.

1.1.0		2009/09/16
	Feature request #SF2839110: Add _FFR_IDENTITY_HEADER, to set an
       		identity (i=) for signing based on the value found in a
		particular header.  Requested by Florian Sager. 
	Fix inside dkimf_libstatus() to return extended status code 
		4.7.5 if temp-fail is due to key retrieval failure.
	Fix bug #SF2831720: Use new dynamic signature header generation
		code (see below).
	Add new exception handling code "keynotfound" (short form "key")
		and "On-KeyNotFound", which handles keys not found in DNS
		separately from other DNS errors.
	Fixes inside dkimf_libstatus() so that SMTP reply codes get set
		properly for temp-fails.
	Remove _FFR_COMMAIZE.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Add dkim_getsighdr_d(), a dynamic-length version of
		dkim_getsighdr().  The old function interface remains
		unchanged for backward compatibility.

	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #SF2839858: Change "default_senderheaders" list
		to include only "from", per RFC5617.  Problem noted
		by Erik Lotspeich.

1.0.0		2009/08/14
	Initial release after code fork from dkim-milter package (v2.8.3).
	Fix bug #SF2813077: Don't do anything other than deliver messages
		when "t=y" is present in the verifying key record.  Problem
		noted by Jens Elkner.
	Fix bug #SF2835208: Set the signal mask earlier so that signals
		of interest aren't delivered to threads that can't handle
		them.  Problem noted by Mike Markley.
	LIBOPENDKIM: Fix bug #SF2795523: Correct canonicalization problem
		when a CRLF is split across body chunks and consecutive
		blank line counting is in progress.  Reported by Mark
		Martinec.
