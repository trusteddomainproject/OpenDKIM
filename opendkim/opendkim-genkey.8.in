.TH opendkim-genkey 8 "The Trusted Domain Project"
.SH NAME
.B opendkim-genkey
\- DKIM filter key generation tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opendkim-genkey
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opendkim-genkey
generates (1) a private key for signing messages using
.I opendkim(8)
and (2) a DNS TXT record suitable for inclusion in a zone file which
publishes the matching public key for use by remote DKIM verifiers.

The filenames of these are based on the selector (see below); the private
key will have a suffix of ".private" and the TXT record will have a suffix
of ".txt".

Both long and short names are supported for most options.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-a
(\-\-append-domain)
Appends the domain name (see \-d below) to the label in the generated
TXT record, followed by a trailing period.  By default it is assumed the
domain name is implicit from the context of the zone file, and is therefore
not included in the output.

.TP
.I \-b bits
(\-\-bits=n)
Specifies the size of the key, in
.I bits,
to be generated.  The default is 1024 which is the value recommended by
the DKIM specification.

.TP
.I \-d domain
(\-\-domain=string)
Names the
.I domain
which will use this key for signing.  Currently only used in a comment in
the TXT record file.  The default is "@DOMAIN@".

.TP
.I \-D directory
(\-\-directory=path)
Instructs the tool to change to the named
.I directory
prior to creating files.  By default the current directory is used.

.TP
.I \-\-ed25519
generate a ed25519 key.

.TP
.I \-h algorithms
(\-\-hash-algorithms=name[:name[...]])
Specifies a list of hash
.I algorithms
which can be used with this key.  By default all hash algorithms are allowed.

.TP
.I \-\-help
Print a help message and exit.

.TP
.I \-n note
(\-\-note=string)
Includes arbitrary
.I note
text in the key record.  By default, no such text is included.

.TP
.I \-r
(\-\-restrict)
Restricts the key for use in e-mail signing only.  The default is to allow
the key to be used for any service.

.TP
.I \-s selector
(\-\-selector=name)
Specifies the
.I selector,
or name, of the key pair generated.  The default is "default".

.TP
.I \-S
(\-\-[no]subdomains)
Disallows subdomain signing by this key.  By default the key record will be
generated such that verifiers are told subdomain signing is permitted.  Note
that for backward compatibility reasons,
.I \-S
means the same as
.I \-\-nosubdomains.

.TP
.I \-t
(\-\-[no]testmode)
Indicates the generated key record should be tagged such that verifiers are
aware DKIM is in test at the signing domain.

.TP
.I -v
(\-\-verbose)
Increase verbose output.

.TP
.I -V
(\-\-version)
Print version number and exit.
.SH NOTES
Requires that the
.I openssl(8)
binary be installed and in the executing shell's search path.
